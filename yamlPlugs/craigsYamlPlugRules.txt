1a) All anchors in common.yaml.csh are accessible to all other .yaml.csh files
1b) All anchors in enkf.yaml.csh or variational.yaml.csh are available to .yaml.csh files
    corresponding to observations but are not visible to common.yaml.csh
1c) Anchors in yaml.csh files corresponding to observations are not available to any other
    yaml.csh file.

2a) The first four lines of each .yaml.csh file should be:
#!/bin/csh
cd $2
set output_fname = $1 # file that is output (added to, given 'cat >>' )
cat >> $output_fname << EOF

They are all the way to the left (no indentation whatsoever)

2b) The fourth line must use "cat >>" (as opposed to "cat >").  Use of "cat >>" is for appending, rather than overwriting.

3) The final line of each .yaml.csh file should be:
EOF

It is all the way to the left (no indentation whatsoever)

4) Indentation in all .yaml.csh files should be all the way to the left (no indentation whatsoever).  run_jedi.csh will add spaces at the start
   of lines as needed

5) When a .yaml.csh file is called from run_jedi.csh, it needs to be given a filename for the output.  That is what
   $1 refers to in the third line.  $2 in the second line is the directory where the file will be written.

6) Partial example:

#!/bin/csh
cd $2
set output_fname = $1 # file that is output (added to, given 'cat >>' )
cat >> $output_fname << EOF
